Contour Detection by Simulating the Curvature Cell in the Visual Cortex and its Application to Object Classification.2020.
Please cite our paper if this code is used to motivate any publications.

To detect contour with the model to an image,run "Demo.m" for an example.

if you want to apply this algorithm to the BSDS500 and the BSDS300 dataset, you will need to download and install the code for applying benchmark, which is availableï¼š http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench/
